# AI Interior Designer

This project serves as a learning exercise, focused on the application of tools and concepts such as Langchain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of large language models.

As the first step of this exercise, I created the Jupyter notebook, `rag.ipynb`, as a step-by-step guide towards creating your first RAG-based LLM call. I have cited all the resources I referenced within the notebook itself.
